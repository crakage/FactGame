Factorial Calculation using Thread

***Factorial of a number is the product of that number and all numbers less than it but greater than zero***

Excercise: Provide the code for the following Java program.
- The program takes an unlimited number of integers as command line arguments
- For each argument it creates a thread which calculates the factorial of that number
- The main thread waits for all worker threads to finish calculating their factorial. 
- The main thread then prints out the result


The main method must go into a waiting state
